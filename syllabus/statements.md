## Classroom Behavior

Both students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate
learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person,
remote or online. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards
may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are
especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with
race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed,
religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression,
veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy. For more
information, see the policies on [classroom
behavior](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior)
and the [Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution
policies](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/student-conduct).

## Requirements for COVID-19

As a matter of public health and safety, all members of the CU Boulder
community and all visitors to campus must follow university, department
and building requirements and all public health orders in place to
reduce the risk of spreading infectious disease. CU Boulder currently
requires COVID-19 vaccination and boosters for all faculty, staff and
students. Students, faculty and staff must upload proof of vaccination
and boosters or file for an exemption based on medical, ethical or moral
grounds through the [MyCUHealth portal](https://mycuhealth.colorado.edu/).

The CU Boulder campus is currently mask-optional. However, if public
health conditions change and masks are again required in classrooms,
students who fail to adhere to masking requirements will be asked to
leave class, and students who do not leave class when asked or who
refuse to comply with these requirements will be referred to [Student
Conduct and Conflict Resolution](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/). For
more information, see the policy on [classroom
behavior](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior)
and the [Student Code of Conduct](http://www.colorado.edu/osccr/). If
you require accommodation because a disability prevents you from
fulfilling these safety measures, please follow the steps in the
"Accommodation for Disabilities" statement on this syllabus.

If you feel ill and think you might have COVID-19, if you have tested
positive for COVID-19, or if you are unvaccinated or partially
vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19,
you should stay home and follow the further guidance of the
[Public Health Office](https://www.colorado.edu/health/public-health/quarantine-and-isolation)
(<contacttracing@colorado.edu>). If you are fully vaccinated and have
been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to
stay home; rather, you should self-monitor for symptoms and follow the
further guidance of the [Public Health Office](https://www.colorado.edu/health/public-health/quarantine-and-isolation)
(<contacttracing@colorado.edu>).

## Accommodation for Disabilities

If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit
your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty
member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed.
Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented
disabilities in the academic environment. Information on requesting
accommodations is located on the [Disability Services
website](https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/). Contact
Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or <dsinfo@colorado.edu> for further
assistance. If you have a temporary medical condition, see [Temporary
Medical
Conditions](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions)
on the Disability Services website.

## Preferred Student Names and Pronouns

CU Boulder recognizes that students\' legal information doesn\'t always
align with how they identify. Students may update their preferred names
and pronouns via the student portal; those preferred names and pronouns
are listed on instructors\' class rosters. In the absence of such
updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the student\'s
legal name.

## Honor Code

All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are
responsible for knowing and adhering to the Honor Code academic
integrity policy. Violations of the Honor Code may include, but are not
limited to: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat,
unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the
same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all
course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. All
incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code
(<honor@colorado.edu>); 303-492-5550). Students found responsible for
violating the academic integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic
sanctions from the Honor Code as well as academic sanctions from the
faculty member. Additional information regarding the Honor Code academic
integrity policy can be found on the [Honor Code
website](https://www.colorado.edu/osccr/honor-code).

## Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination, Harassment and/or Related Retaliation

CU Boulder is committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming
learning, working, and living environment. The university will not
tolerate acts of sexual misconduct (harassment, exploitation, and
assault), intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence),
stalking, or protected-class discrimination or harassment by or against
members of our community. Individuals who believe they have been subject
to misconduct or retaliatory actions for reporting a concern should
contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at
303-492-2127 or email <cureport@colorado.edu>. Information about
university policies, [reporting
options](https://www.colorado.edu/oiec/reporting-resolutions/making-report),
and the support resources can be found on the [OIEC
website](http://www.colorado.edu/institutionalequity/).

Please know that faculty and graduate instructors have a responsibility
to inform OIEC when they are made aware of incidents of sexual
misconduct, dating and domestic violence, stalking, discrimination,
harassment and/or related retaliation, to ensure that individuals
impacted receive information about their rights, support resources, and
reporting options. To learn more about reporting and support options for
a variety of concerns, visit [Don't Ignore
It](https://www.colorado.edu/dontignoreit/).

## Religious Holidays

Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make
every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who,
because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams,
assignments or required attendance.

See the [campus policy regarding religious
observances](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/observance-religious-holidays-and-absences-classes-andor-exams)
